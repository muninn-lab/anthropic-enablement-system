Module Title: What Plugins Are and How They Work

Description: Cover the basics of Claude Code plugins; what they enable, core concepts, how they extend functionality, and examples of common use cases.

# Plugins

> Create custom plugins to extend Claude Code with skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers.

Plugins let you extend Claude Code with custom functionality that can be shared across projects and teams. This guide covers creating your own plugins with skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers.

## When to use plugins vs standalone configuration

Claude Code supports two ways to add custom skills, agents, and hooks:

| Approach                                                    | Skill names          | Best for                                                                                        |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standalone** (`.claude/` directory)                       | `/hello`             | Personal workflows, project-specific customizations, quick experiments                          |
| **Plugins** (directories with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) | `/plugin-name:hello` | Sharing with teammates, distributing to community, versioned releases, reusable across projects |

**Use standalone configuration when**:

* You're customizing Claude Code for a single project
* The configuration is personal and doesn't need to be shared
* You're experimenting with skills or hooks before packaging them
* You want short skill names like `/hello` or `/review`

**Use plugins when**:

* You want to share functionality with your team or community
* You need the same skills/agents across multiple projects
* You want version control and easy updates for your extensions
* You're distributing through a marketplace
* You're okay with namespaced skills like `/my-plugin:hello` (namespacing prevents conflicts between plugins)


<Tip>
  Start with standalone configuration in `.claude/` for quick iteration, then [convert to a plugin](#convert-existing-configurations-to-plugins) when you're ready to share.
